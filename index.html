					<h3 class="floatl">My past</h3>
					<p class="floatl">I've been interested in tech all my life, and started
					my programming journey when I was 12. I love making websites and learning more programming languages in my free
					time. I've studied many programming languages at school, inluding HTML, CSS,
					Javascript, C#, and Python.</p>
					</div>
					
				<div class="mainright">
					<img class="floatr" src="spare.jpg">
					<h3 class="floatl">Spare time</h3>
					<p class="floatl">Outside of of school and technology, I enjoy playing the piano, playing the kalimba, and exposing myself to art and new ideas to
					stay open-minded and creative. And even though I love coding, I also enjoy learning non-programming languages; I'm fluent in English, Dutch, Portuguese, and I'm
					learning French, German, and Korean.</p>

						<h3>Experience</h3>
						<p>I often enrich my knowledge in my free time to challenge and improve myself with new things and refresh what I already know, so I've racked up some experience in the last few years. Here are some that i've highlighted!
						<br><br><small><a href="projects.html">If you want to see <i>all</i> of my projects instead of just the highlights, click here.</a></small></p>

						<h3 class="floatl">EF Seoul</h3>
						<p class="floatl">Education First is a language exchange program which takes people from all over the world to countries that speak the language they are learning. In 2025, I took part in this program and lived in Seoul, South Korea to study Korean.</p>

					<div class="flower" id="botl">
						<img class="floatr" src="codingcore2.png">
						<h3 class="floatl">Coding Core</h3>
						<p class="floatl">Coding Core is a website that includes programming resources such as images, pixels, gifs, HTML help (stackoverflow, HTML validator, etc), a note system, and more. I made and designed it for myself, but I do have plans to generalize it and release it.</p>

					<h3 class="floatl">Now <a target="_blank" href="https://nownownow.com/about">(?)</a></h3>
					<p class="floatl">Academically, I'm still in highschool, year 5 of VWO level. I've started looking into plans for after graduation, and I'm working hard to become an impressive applicant.
					<br>Personally, I'm learning to accept and express myself. Rediscovering my love for the arts and classic media. Committing to exercising daily, and generally taking better care of my body. Overall in my "era" of personal growth. :)</p>
					</div>
					
				<div class="mainright">
					<img class="floatr" src="future.jpg">
					<h3 class="floatl">My future</h3>
					<p class="floatl">I've always struggled to think about what I want for my future, because I love two opposites; arts and computers. I hope that I can find a way to combine the two in the future.
					<br>And so, I aim to dive deeper into game development; the perfect combination of the two. Webdevelopment is a close second, so I'll be maintaining my skills there as well.</p>
